# RMHD_lightcurves
Please find our publicly available simulation light curves

Each file is labeled by the run and whether it contains an X-ray or UV light curve. All of the light curves (except the light curve from the grey run) have a standard and high cadence version. The first column provides the time in days. Day zero is when we first begin injecting X-rays. The second column provides the flux in code units. While the flux units are arbitrary the relative flux between different runs and light curves is consistent.
